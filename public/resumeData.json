      "pp1": "My previous experiences included analyzing customer experiences through website landing pages, content creation and email automation tools such as Pardot and Eloqua. I have over a decade of experience with Adobe Suite creating content in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I have managed websites as part of my marketing duties and developed them using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and managing Content Management Suite (CMS) platforms. This allowed me to create a passion for coding and developing websites and their technologies. I was fortunate to take on more responsibility coding and developing these corporate websites and learned more about JavaScript and project management platforms.", 
      "pp2": "I needed a way to learn more and enrolled at LearningFuze, and take night classes while still holding my job. While at Learning Fuze I was given challenging programming problems to solve. Engaging me and exposing me to more technologies such as JavaScript, jQuery, React and NodeJs. My knowledge grew as a front end developer as I worked on several React applications. NodeJs and Express exposed me to working as a back-end developer as I edited databases and made even more progress.", 
      "pp3": "My experience managing campaigns for customer experiences combined with my skills as a Web Developer would make me a fantastic asset to your team. I would love the opportunity to bring my passion and dedication to web development to your company."
