## Description
This is my personal portfolio site featuring an overview of who I am, my skills, experience, and major projects. Feel free to visit the site and learn more about my work. Don't hesitate to reach out - I'm always looking to explore new opportunities. 

## Technologies
This site is built using a **ReactJS template** shared by Tim Baker on github. I modified it to feature my own professional content and adjusted the contact component to suit my current needs. Tim Baker's template was developed by breaking a **Ceevee template by Styleshout** into the ReactJS components with data fed from a **JSON File**. Credits and a link to the template's repo on Tim Baker's github account are provided below.
